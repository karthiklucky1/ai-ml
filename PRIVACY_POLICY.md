# Smart Prompt Engine Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 5, 2026

Smart Prompt Engine ("the extension") helps users improve prompts before sending them to supported AI websites.

## What data we process

- Prompt text you type or select while using supported sites.
- Basic request metadata needed to operate the service (for example, request timing and service errors).
- A generated local extension user identifier stored in Chrome storage for request handling.

## How data is used

- To score prompts, suggest rewrites, and provide token-saving compression.
- To return results to the extension UI.
- To maintain service reliability (for example, rate limiting and troubleshooting).

## Data sharing and selling

- We do **not** sell personal data.
- We do **not** use your data for advertising.
- We do **not** provide third-party ad tracking.

## Data retention

- Most processing is request-based.
- Cached and operational logs may be retained for limited technical purposes.
- We do not intentionally store unnecessary personal data.

## Third-party services

- Prompt processing requests are sent to the Smart Prompt Engine backend.
- The backend may use third-party AI providers (such as OpenAI) to generate rewrite suggestions.

## Your choices

- You can stop data processing by disabling or uninstalling the extension.
- You can avoid using rewrite/compression features if you do not want prompt text sent to backend services.

## Security

- We use reasonable technical measures to protect data in transit and at rest.
- No method is 100% secure, but we continuously improve safeguards.
